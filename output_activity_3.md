[Activity 3]: Participate in a meeting to discuss hazards and risk assessment and control
[Answer]: In the meeting with my assessor to discuss the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Tool, I presented the hazards I had identified for the upcoming open day event at the prestigious education institution. I explained each hazard in detail, including the risk rating and suggested risk controls for each one. I provided rationale for each risk control method, emphasizing the importance of mitigating these risks to ensure the health and safety of all attendees.

During the meeting, my assessor suggested additional controls for some hazards, which we discussed thoroughly. I incorporated these suggestions into my Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Tool, updating it to reflect the views of others and to enhance the overall risk management plan for the event.

I have filed my work as "Final Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Tool" in the folder structure as requested. The screenshots of the folder structure and files have been submitted to my assessor for review.
