## Activity 1: Review the Best Events Catering WHS Policy and Procedures and access relevant documentation

Scenario: 
You are a student working on a project for Best Events Catering company. Your task is to review the company's WHS Policy and Procedures to identify procedures for hazard identification and risk assessment for an event. After reviewing the policy, you need to access the WHS Plan template provided and submit a Draft Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment. This assessment should include a minimum of 10 actual or foreseeable hazards with associated risk assessment and controls. You will then participate in a meeting with your assessor to discuss the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Tool, incorporating suggestions for risk controls and updating the final version for submission.
