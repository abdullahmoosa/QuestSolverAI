[Activity 1]: Review the Best Events Catering WHS Policy and Procedures and access relevant documentation
[Answer]: 
I have reviewed the Best Events Catering WHS Policy and Procedures to identify the procedures that need to be followed, as well as methods for hazard identification and risk assessment for an event. The WHS Plan template includes the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Tool from the Student Resources folder. I have carefully reviewed these documents in preparation for the next task and made notes as required.
