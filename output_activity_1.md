[Activity 1]: Review the Best Events Catering WHS Policy and Procedures and access relevant documentation
[Answer]: 
I have reviewed the Best Events Catering WHS Policy and Procedures to identify the procedures that need to be followed, as well as methods for hazard identification and risk assessment for an event. The policy outlines the importance of conducting thorough assessments of potential hazards related to the physical environment, equipment and machinery, food preparation and serving process, and security issues. It also emphasizes the need for implementing safety protocols, providing staff with proper training, and conducting regular inspections.

In preparation for the next task, I have accessed the WHS Plan template that includes the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Tool from the Student Resources folder. I will carefully review these documents and make notes as required to ensure that all safety measures are effectively implemented for the upcoming open day event catering.
